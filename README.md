Practices:
Refactor your code to populate the locations and the owners from your API.
Once you have everything rendering, remove the empty arrays you defined in the state object so you can see how the React lifecycle works. What happened when you removed them?


Challenge:
Advanced Challenge: Search your Data
Remember that challenges, especially advanced ones, are completely optional and should not be attempted until you have completed the practice exercises and understand the concepts used in them.

Not for the weak of heart, is this challenge. Put an input box in your navigation bar. When your customer types in any characters, then you must find any objects in the animals, locations, or employees collections that have a name which contains that string.

When the customer presses the ENTER key, all three collections in your API need to be queried to find any item that matches, and then a new component should be shown whose job it is to show the items that were found, if any.
